Our mission at Fondify is to build the best donation platform on the Solana blockchain. We're committed to making donations safe and easy for anyone to get or give help.

To make Fondify accessible to everyone, we charge 0% platform fees for donation transactions. Our platform is fully decentralized and runs entirely on the Solana blockchain. We do not collect any personal data and provide censor-resistant tools for people all around the world.

We have many ideas and plans going forward, and every sponsor will help with the motivation and the money needed to create this great software.

We appreciate [your support](https://fondify.app/to/9qjvN4GZf78M2JsLUxXUNQWnDo96s12Zzzkzoo8cFpqw) ❤️.
